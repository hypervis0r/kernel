# kernel
My first experience with OS development cause I'm bored lol

~~It does very little as of now, so tune in as I add more to this thing~~

x86 BIOS Bootloader and kernel. Honest to god I wouldn't call this a kernel. No priv switching, memory management, etc.
Also abandoned because I realized how dumb making an x86 BIOS compatible kernel in 2021 is.
I've started on kernel2 which is AMD64 UEFI compatible, but it also doesn't do much lol.
